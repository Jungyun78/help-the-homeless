## Motivation
We are a team of four UIUC sophomore students who are determined to apply technology to make an impact in our community. We have noticed that homelessness is a huge problem in the Urbana-Champaign area. Participating in PYGHACK 2019, we had the opportunity to analyze Champaign County homeless datasets offered by CU at Home, a local organization that supports homeless people, and develop a website that direct people in need of living spaces to the most recommended shelters as a solution.


## Team

Ana and Rashi worked on front-end, website development. We used Flask as a microframework and used it with Python to load in static HTML, CSS and Javascript files. We also created the UI for the entire project.
